	<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>Attending Eastern Washington University to earn a Bachelor of Arts in Visual Communication Design with a minor in Film Studies. Currently a Senior and planning on graduating Spring 2015. Started building computers from parts at the age of seven, and took all art classes provided by Orchard Prairie School, City School, Centennial Middle School and West Valley High School. Also took welding and video game programming during high school at Spokane Skills Center. Attended Spokane Community College to obtain a two-year transfer degree.
